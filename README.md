# React with SWR: Pokemon API

## About
This project allows fetching data from the Pokemon API using React and SWR (Stale-While-Revalidate). SWR is a React Hooks library for remote data fetching. The objective of this project is to utilize React and SWR to fetch data from the Pokemon API. Once SWR is imported into a React project, data is automatically fetched and cached, ensuring a fast and responsive user experience.
